Akka is the name of a beautiful mountain(that Jonas climbed and skied some years age) in the Laponia region in Northern Sweden.
The mountain is also sometimes called 'The Queen of Laponia'. Akka is also the name of a goddness in the Sami(the native Swedish population)mythology.
She is the goddness that stands for all the beauty and good in the world. The mountain can be seen as the symbol of this goddness.
Also,the name AKKA is the palindrome of letters A and K as in Actor Kernel and returns very few hits on Google.
